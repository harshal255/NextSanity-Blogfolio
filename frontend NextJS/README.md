# My Portfolio Website

This is my dynamic portfolio web-application created using the Next.js framework. It has a clean and modern design using Tailwind CSS. I have incorporated JavaScript libraries such as Next UI to make components responsive, Tilt.js and AOS animation to enhance user experience, Email.js for form validation, and Headless UI for styled components. For the backend services, I used Sanity CMS and GROQ query language. You can see my blog post and my story as well in my portfolio.
